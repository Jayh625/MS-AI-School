--- Dataset description ---

Each object (glue tube) is described with it's bounding box and two keypoints. 

Annotations for each image contain:
- coordinates of bounding boxes (each object has a bounding box, which is described with top left and bottom right corners in [x1, y1, x2, y2] format);
- coordinates of keypoints (each object has 2 keypoints, which are described in [x, y, visibility] format).

In this dataset all keypoints are visible (i.e. visibility=1).

First keypoint - head
Second keypoint - tail
